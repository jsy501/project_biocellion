Current assumptions

- Lto cell is stationary.
- every bind between Lto and Lti/Ltin cells is permanent.
- Lti/Ltin cells will stop moving once they bind to Lto cell.
- Lti/Ltin cells move randomly in all direction, following gaussian distribution.
- chemokine diffusion occurs instantaneous.
- chemokine concentration is identical across the grid.
